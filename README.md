# Slap Jack Mania

### A reaction-based card game


This application represents a game of Slap Jack, 
with a **Normal** mode and a **Mania** mode. These modes will consist of different rules, 
and flips and slaps will be represented by certain keys
(depending on how many players are in the game). 

Up to four players can participate in this multiplayer game.
Players can either continue as a guest or create an account.
There will be an option to save your account, and there will be a billboard to
accumulate each account's total wins, games played, as well as a streak count
of consecutive wins.

This project is of interest to me because Slap Jack is one of my favorite card games.
In fact, my friends and I have developed new rules a long time ago for a harder version because the normal Slap Jack was too easy.
I call this Mania mode, and I am familiar with the rules as I have played many times.
I have always wanted to code some sort of interactive game, and this project is the perfect opportunity to do so.
I believe this will be a fun project to work on.
